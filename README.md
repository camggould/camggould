| Palm oil is one of the worlds most versatile vegetable oils, but unsustainable harvesting has led to deforestation, the destruction of habitats, and harm to local communities. Support sustainable palm oil initiatives by shopping for products that have the [RSPO label](https://rspo.org/as-an-organisation/our-trademark/products-with-rspo-label/), indicating they are RSPO certified for using sustainable sources of palm oil. |

This is my official GitHub. I recently created a new one because my old one was full of junk.
